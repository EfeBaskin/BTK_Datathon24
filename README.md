# BTK_Datathon24

I participated in my first datathon, where my team ranked 141st out of 364 teams and 575 participants. Unfortunately, we couldn't get a higher place, but this datathon showed me where I lack in certain areas and taught me valuable lessons.

We were given a training dataset containing real-life data from 2014 to 2022. The goal was to predict scholarship scores for the test data in 2023.
